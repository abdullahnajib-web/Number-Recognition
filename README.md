# Number Recognition

The program is designed to recognize numbers using Keras models and display the results on an Arduino-based display. 
It involves training a machine learning model with Keras, a deep learning library, to classify and recognize numerical digits. 
Once the model is trained, it can accept input images containing handwritten or printed digits. 
The program then processes these images and uses the trained model to predict the numbers. 
The results are subsequently displayed on an Arduino-powered display, providing a visual output of the recognized numbers. 
This combination of machine learning and hardware integration allows for accurate and real-time digit recognition, making it suitable for various applications, such as digit recognition systems or educational tools.
